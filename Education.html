    <h2>Education Background</h2>
    <p>
        I began my journey in boarding school at a young age, quickly assuming the role of prefect and excelling in both academics and interpersonal relations. Transitioning to The Kenya High School, I continued to thrive as a leader in both academic and dormitory settings, alongside active participation in extracurricular activities like football and swimming.</p> 
        <p>
         I participated in innovative initiatives such as the Community Service-Learning club, where I played a pivotal role in testing the new Competency Based Curriculum (CBC).Building strong relationships with peers and faculty was a cornerstone of my experience. Following successful completion of my KSCE exams, I embarked on my tertiary education journey at the University of Nairobi's School of Engineering in September 2021, pursuing a Degree in Bachelor of Science in Geospatial Engineering.
